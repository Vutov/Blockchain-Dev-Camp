With the prices of all currencies taking a dive in the last week I'm not sure how good are any of the calculations. In any case I'm considering build 6 x ATI 570s. They are roughtly 1500 bgn. With the current dificulties on the currencies and price it will make a profit ot ~8$ a day, 14 bgn. Last week it was ~14$ a day. With this volatile market it is very hard to predict when the initial investment of ~10k bgn will pay of, but it should be profitable withing a year.
